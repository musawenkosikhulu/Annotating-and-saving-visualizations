# Annotating-and-saving-visualizations
In this activity, Iâ€™ll review a scenario, and practice adding annotations to a data visualization with ggplot2. I will also learn how to save images from ggplot2 visualizations so that I can add them directly to presentations

As a junior data analyst for a hotel booking company, I have been creating visualizations in `R` with the `ggplot2`  package to share insights about your data with stakeholders. After creating a series of visualizations using `ggplot()`, `ggplot2` aesthetics, and filters, your stakeholder asks you to add annotations to your visualizations to help explain my findings in a presentation. Luckily, `ggplot2` has annotation functions built in.
